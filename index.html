        <p class="dek">When Taylor Swift released her first self-titled album, no one knew just how popular she would become. Now, Swift’s name is found in every news publication, billboard, and music chart.</p>

        <p>The 35 year old singer has made a clear name for herself throughout the years, but many argue that it’s only now that she’s reached her peak success and fame. Swift’s <a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eras Tour</em></a>, which consisted of 149 shows over a year and a half, amassed a gross of $2 billion, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticket-sales.html?unlocked_article_code=1.h04.R0Lg.ZS6nRhYik8Lh&smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, which is more than any other concert tour in history. Averaging her tickets at a shocking $200, Swift and her production team delivered performances, merchandise, and three new albums, growing her fame and fortune to mind-numbing numbers. </p>

        <p>Her popularity is not a surprise to anyone. What does come as a surprise, however, is the genre of which she gains popularity.</p>

        <p><strong><awesome>Pop Star to “Adult Contemporary” </awesome></strong></p>

        <p>The general public can recall her late 2010s albums, like <em>Lover</em> or <em>reputation</em>, which user Jarred Priester notes are considered the most danceable projects of hers. But Priester’s dataset shows that her mellow, acoustic, non-danceable songs are gaining more popularity now more than ever. When dissecting the correlations between popularity and specific factors of music, such as energy, liveliness, variables returned negative. </p>

        <p>Her most recent album, <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, embodies these mellow, acoustic, non-danceable and heartfelt ballads from the singer, with songs like <em>Fortnite</em> boasting a play count closer to the billions. Since the release of her 2017 album, <em>reputation</em>, Swift has written 95 songs considered under this genre tag. Before <em>reputation</em>, she only wrote 32 “adult contemporary” songs out of the 77 released. Swift reached her career-peak for "adult contemporary" songs in her re-release of <em> Red (Taylor's Version)</em> in 2021.</p>

        <p>Senior Data Analyst Madeline Clark has also devoted time to <a href="https://taylor-swift-discography.streamlit.app/Collaborators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyzing Swift’s songs and trends throughout her career.</a> Clark titles songs like <em>Fortnite</em> as “Adult Contemporary.” As an analyst and Swift fan, she sees this surge in the singer’s success and fame as no surprise. Listeners are now interested in “singer-songwriter music,” Clark says, noting other successful singers, such as Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan. She says that the pop music world is “corporate,” and steering away from the business aspects of music and writing songs that “feel personal” allow for listeners to resonate. </p>

        <p>Swift’s recent change in music style “doesn’t feel like it’s meant to sell anything,” Clark says, “it’s music for the sake of music.</p>

        <p><strong><awesome>The Singer-Songwriter Music Wave </awesome></strong></p>

        <p>It’s not just fans like Clark who notice the surge in singer-songwriter music. It’s also seen in the people; the listeners.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/music/article/best-albums-2024-0g659vwpj?utm_source=chatgpt.com&region=global" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Times</em></a>’ article on the best albums of 2024, Swift was spotted with artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, and Beyoncé. Artists like Eilish and Beyoncé have built their popularity through writing heartfelt songs and powerful messages delivered across their projects. Eilish’s <em>HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</em> introduced themes of body image and romance, while Beyoncé’s <em>COWBOY CARTER</em> explored themes of family and freedom. These artists have paved the path for sympathetic music writing that has, in return, given them accolades and massive support.</p>

        <p>In the upcoming GRAMMY award season, the most coveted award for musicians, all four of these artists are nominated, with Swift earning six nominations and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13831785/grammy-awards-nominations-beyonce-taylor-swift/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking the record</a> for the most nominations for Album of the Year. Nominations are selected by a panel of judges called the Recording Academy, consisting of industry professionals in all fields, such as production, songwriting, and instrumental.</p> 

        <p>The wave of acoustic singer-songwriting is big and clear in the music industry, and it’s people like Swift who are in the frontlines of it.</p>

        <p><strong><awesome>Shaking Off Danceability Throughout the Years </awesome></strong></p>

        <p>Swift, in particular, is steering away from her past pop princess title and dancing away from danceability. Data shows that the average score for danceability decreases as Swift releases more albums. The singer’s highest danceability average was for <em>Lover</em> (2019)  and <em>reputation</em> (2017) (0.66), whereas her lowest was for <em>evermore (deluxe version)</em> (2020) and <em>The Tortured Poet's Department: The Anthology</em> (2024) (0.53). Ever since <em>Lover</em>, Swift has made albums that average 0.63 points or less on danceability, meaning that her songs have become less danceable. </p>

        <p>This change can result in many things. It can result from Swift’s personal style change as she gets older. It can result in the change of public opinion and business. Or it can change from the people she works with.</p>

         <p><strong><awesome>Jack Antonoff: The Scapegoat</awesome></strong></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/taylor-swift-midnights-jack-antonoff-criticism/671911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a> notes that Swift’s album Midnights sounds similar to her previous works with Jack Antonoff, a singer-songwriter and producer who works with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/23/jack-antonoff-pop-music-collaboration-lorde-taylor-swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone’s favorite music stars</a>. The public thinks the same. Comments about Swift’s discography all sounding the same circulates the media consistently, and all reasons point towards Antonoff. But Clark argues that this take is invalid. She points out that Antonoff’s collaborations with other artists differs from his projects with Swift. </p>

        <p>“Taylor Swift fans, who don’t like [her] music, don’t want to blame her, they want to blame somebody else, so [Jack Antonoff] is the scapegoat in that regard,” says Clark. </p>

        <p>“At the end of the day, it’s Taylor Swift who makes the decisions on songs,” says Clark. And if her songs sound the same, so what? There’s no <a href="https://youtu.be/QcIy9NiNbmo?si=bFZnKWhilLjlMNha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Blood</a>.</p> 

         <p><strong><awesome>End of an Era</awesome></strong></p>

        <p>So, what’s next for the pop princess? Her options are endless. </p>

        <p>In Swift’s 2020 documentary <em>Miss Americana</em>, viewers watched her take a step back from the public eye due to high criticism, the singer noting that she felt as if she’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/taylor-swifts-self-scrutiny-in-miss-americana?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost control of her own life</a>. After completing a highly successful yet taxing tour, some think it’s time for Swift to hibernate. </p>

        <p>“I think that she is so successful right now, and she has generated so much money and attention, that she’s just going to end up doing whatever she wants,” says Clark, noting other celebrities who have taken this route, such as Beyoncé.</p>

        <p>Though “doing whatever she wants” for Swift could mean releasing more music, Clark is convinced that this may not happen. </p>

        <p>“It’s a matter of, is she going to continue leaning into [releasing music], or is she eventually going to say, ‘I don’t want to be this popstar anymore,’ and I think she’s reached a point,” says Clark.</p>

        <p>The Taylor Swift Era is uncertain for now, but her mark on the industry is clear. Whether she continues to release music or chooses a different path, her legacy in shaping the music industry is already undeniable.</p>
