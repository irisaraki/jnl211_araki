			<h3>Background</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>Taylor Swift has been in the public eye and media ever since she was 16 - and even years before then. Swift is a generational talent, with little to no argument. Though many people have mixed opinions about her, her individual impact on the music industry is clear and significant, making her one of the most notable figures in the industry itself. Releasing over 24 albums and EPs, Swift’s analytical statistics of many categories, spanning from danceability to popularity, are useful to decipher what fans of Swift favor. With the new emergence of pop-talent, such as Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, analyzing Swift’s success through data can offer strategies for emerging artists to replicate to further launch their careers.
